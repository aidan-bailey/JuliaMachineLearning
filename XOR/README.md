# XOR

The [exclusive-OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) (XOR) is an operation in [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra).

In terms of binary [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate), it takes in two inputs (0 or 1) and outputs 1 if either (not both) of the inputs are 1. 

The truth-table is thus

| Input1 | Input2 | Output |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 0      | 0      | 0      |
| 0      | 1      | 1      |
| 1      | 0      | 1      |
| 1      | 1      | 0      |

XOR is a very simple classification problem.

Showing it was solvable using artificial neural networks was one of [the first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)) major indicators of their potential.
